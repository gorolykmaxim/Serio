# Android port of Serio

This is the primary port of Serio and the place where most support resources go
to.

Works on mobile devices as well as on the android TVs (which are the
primary support target btw).

Hosts the UI in a WebView. Stores data in an SQLite database. Uses AsyncHttpClient
to crawl websites.
